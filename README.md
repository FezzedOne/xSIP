# xSIP

This is a fork of Silverfeelin's [Spawnable Item Pack](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-SpawnableItemPack) that adds automatic support for all modded items[^1] (if you're using [xStarbound](https://github.com/xStarbound/xStarbound) or [OpenStarbound](https://github.com/OpenStarbound/OpenStarbound)) and support for [FezzedTech](https://github.com/FezzedOne/FezzedTech) items. See the Spawnable Item Pack's readme for more on the original mod.

[^1]: Before you ask, [@SilverSokolova](https://github.com/SilverSokolova), this feature was developed independently of (and *before*) the similar one later added to «upstream» SIP.
